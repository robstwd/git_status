n1 = tracked file, modified, staged & ready for commit

n3 = untracked file, added, not staged

IRB test
path = "~/scripts/Projects/git_status"
result = `cd #{path} && git status -s`
change_list = message.split("\n")
change_list.collect! { |change| change[0...2] }
change_list.each do | change |
	does it have a value in the first char?  => puts 1 staged file
	does it have a value in the second char? => puts 1 unstaged & modified file

for each:	
is it "??" => change[0...2] == "??"
	if Y, untracked: += 1
does it have a value in the first char? => change[0] != " "
if y, staged: += 1
does it have a value in the second char?  => change[1] != " "
if y, unstaged: += 1

added this to test git
